## RAM 205 - Robotics and Automation

### [RAM205](../../) - [Sprint 2](../) - P02 Testing

### P02 Testing 

No Zoom class session
  - Complete *on your own* during specified class session
  - Submit the required solution as a zip file to the Moodle link on the main page. 
  - You must zip the entire solution with functional links using valid file names.
  - Submit your zipped solution by the end of the class period. The submission link will be disabled at the end of the class session. 

#### Directions
1. Open your RAM205 solution on your piRover and create a weekP02 folder.
2. **Copy all class files from the prior week to the new weekP02 folder.** Do not copy prior test files, but you can reference these as you complete this assessment.
3. Create the p02_testing.py file in your solution folder either by creating the file and then copying the contents of this p02_testing.py file or by using the wget command below in a terminal window.

```Console
wget https://k2controls.github.io/piRover02/sprint2/week10/p02/p02_testing.py  
```

4. Complete the required test code as specified in the *p02_testing.py* file. Use your class files created during Sprint 2 and reference prior testing files as required.
5. Zip the weekP02 folder including the test file and all related class files. 
6. Submit your zip file to the Moodle link on the main page. You must submit by the end of the class period. The submission link will be disabled at the end of  the class session. 
7. Be sure you are zipping the entire folder including all class code files. Credit will not be given if class files are not included. Your solution must be complete including valid links to class files. Double check file name to be sure class files are imported as directed.
