**Session 2**

- Introduction to Python classes
- AI Prompt: What is the advantage of using classes when programming in Python?

- Here's a great reference with even more on a Dog class example.
    - [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/){:target="_blank"}

- Dog class - an example

- LED class - interface planning
    - Review your RAM155 piRover solution (~/piRover/workingP03)
    - Locate your piRover_led.py module
    - Identify the properties and methods for a single LED
    - Edit [this text document](LED.txt){:target="_blank"} and list.
    - Are there other methods that we should include in our class?
    - Be sure to include any required or optional parameters when defining LED methods.

- LED() class with demo
- RGB_LED() class with demo
