- Digital Outputs
  - Switching - high side vs low side 
    - AI Prompt - "I'm learning how to interface electronic control circuits to microcontroller outputs. I'm specifically working on a Raspberry Pi. I'm trying to understand high-side versus low-side switching and when I should be activating an output circuit with a logic high from an output port versus and logic low fron an output port. First, please explain high-side vs low-side using basic switches."
    - AI Prompt = "Can you locate a schematic diagram that uses switches to explain high-side and low-side?"
