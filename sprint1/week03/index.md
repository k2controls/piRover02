### Assignments

- PE1: Module 1 Test
  - screen capture included showing score
  - Test scores are recorded
- Video presentation (50 points)
  - The use of Zoom video is required so that your computer screen showing diagrams, data, and code can be shared.
  - Requirements: Internal Resistance of a Power Source
    1. Introduction: Introduce the activity including Rs and its relationship to battery quality, capacity, and voltage regulation. (see resources)
    2. Testing Procedure: Use either the AA battery test or the piRover battery test to outline steps.
    3. Test setup: include either an image of your test setup or include the test setup as part of your video.
    5. Circuit Analysis: Share an image of the circuit showning Rs as a part of a voltage source. Describe how the value of Rs was determined for the **piRover battery**. Discuss terminal voltage, voltage drop, current flow, Ohm's law, KVL, etc.
    5. Summary: Close with a summary of the activity. What did you learn?
